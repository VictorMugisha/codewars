### Create a function called `fetchUserTodos` that uses the `Promise.all()` method to fetch users and todos concurrently from the provided API endpoints and combine them based on the `userId`. The function should return a promise that resolves with the combined data.

- Users endpoints [`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)
- Todos endpoints [`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos`](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos) The returned promise should resolve into an array of users, where each user object has a new key `todos`. This key should contain an array of todos that belong to the user, determined by matching the `userId` of the todo with the `id` of the user. User objects may look like

```javascript

  // User object may look like
  {
      id: 10,
    name: 'Clementina DuBuque',
    ...
  }

  // Todo object may look like
  {
      userId: 5,
    completed: false,
      ...
  }

  // The result array will have objects that look like

  {
      id: 10,
    name: 'Clementina DuBuque',
    todos: [
          {
              userId: 10,
            completed: false,
              ...
          },
          {
              userId: 10,
            completed: false,
              ...
          }
      ]
      ...
  }

```
