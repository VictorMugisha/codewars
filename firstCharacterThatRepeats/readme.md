# First Character That Repeats (6 kyu)

## DESCRIPTION:
### Find the first character that repeats in a String and return that character.

```javascript
firstDup('tweet') => 't'
firstDup('like') => undefined
```

### This is not the same as finding the character that repeats first. In that case, an input of 'tweet' would yield 'e'.

### Another example:

### In `'translator'` you should return `'t'`, not `'a'`.
```javasript
v      v  
translator
  ^   ^
```
### While second `'a'` appears before second `'t'`, the first `'t'` is before the first `'a'`.
