#### 1. Create a function called createAlarm that generates a wake-up message for a person after a specified time delay. This function should accept two parameters: the person's name and the delay time in seconds.The function should return a promise that resolves with the wake-up message (e.g.Wake up person) but if the delay is less than 2 seconds,the promise should be immediately rejected with an error message stating Delay is not sufficient

#### 2. Write a JavaScript function that fetches data from multiple APIs concurrently and returns a combined result using Promises
